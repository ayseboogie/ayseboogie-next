          <h1>Hey, I&apos;m Ayse.</h1>
          <p>I am a frontend engineer with a passion for web development.</p>
          I enjoy taking on new challenges and continuously growing my skill
          set.
          <br />
          I am a React developer by day. I have built freelance sites with
          WordPress and Duda. I have upcoming projects in Wix and Shopify.
          <br />I developed this website with React in the NextJS framework
          using Tailwind styling.
          <br />I received my computer science degree, with a business
          administration minor, from UT Chattanooga.
          <br />
          <br />
          Other than staring at a computer screen, a few of the things I enjoy
          include bicycling, paddleboarding, hiking, snowboarding, traveling,
          and scrabble.

            &quot;We are the music makers, And we are the dreamers of dreams,
            Wandering by lone sea-breakers, And sitting by desolate streams; â€”
            World-losers and world-forsakers, On whom the pale moon gleams: Yet
            we are the movers and shakers Of the world for ever, it seems.&quot;
